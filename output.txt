The continuing coronavirus situation has reduced the number of live, 
“in-person” summer opportunities for students. However, an increasing 
number of programs have switched over to virtual formats, so students 
should consider & focus on these programs, in addition to the traditional 

opportunities. These online options, along with other virtual resources, 
are listed at the beginning of each Category Section below, under this 
heading: ​Online Opportunities and Resources. 
And many online academic classes (such as CUNY’s College Now free 
program) are available and excellent options – check the ACADEMICS 
section for some of these courses, which will be updated every week. 
Students and parents are welcome to send any suggestions as to 
available online academic (& other) offerings that they are aware of to: 
hblumm@stuy.edu​  - we will share your helpful information with the 
Stuy community! 
 
Please note that many of the opportunities listed below have final 
application deadlines of ​April 30 or May 1. ​Students should apply to 
any that match their interests or enable them to help the community. 
Given all the uncertainty attached to our current situation, you should 
consider any options that seem suitable and beneficial.

RETURN TO TOP 

 

Most colleges and universities are aware of the disruptions and difficulties 
students are currently facing in continuing their usual academic & 
extracurricular activities. Many colleges have sent messages to high schools to 
reassure students and staff of their awareness of the reduced availability of 
student opportunities, both inside & outside of school.  
 
One typical message, part of which is copied below, came from the Columbia 
University Admissions Office. As a Stuyvesant student you can and should 
continue to explore and apply to summer activities programs that are of interest 
(and that you’ll enjoy). But keep in mind that the higher education community 
understands the challenges you are facing in this aspect of your high school 
experience. 
 
“Furthermore, as we consider younger students, we understand that disruptions 
may significantly alter the trajectory of their extracurricular, athletic and other 
pursuits. Students might not have access to summer programs or other 

enrichment experiences. Their college applications will likely look different 
than they have in the past. We remain committed to our holistic and contextual 
review process that considers the individual circumstances that shape each 
applicant's journey.”

If you are selected for or enroll in any of the above opportunities, please inform 
Mr. Blumm ASAP at: ​hblumm@stuy.edu  
And whichever extra-curricular program, internship, or community service activity

supervisor/coordinator to write a letter of appreciation before it concludes – it is 
sometimes very difficult to obtain this later on. And the more personal & detailed 
the letter, the better. A copy should then be submitted to the Guidance office 
(Room 236).
